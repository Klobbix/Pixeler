### Human-like Automation and Screen Reading OCR for Python

Pixeler is a Python library that enables developers to create sophisticated automation bots capable of reading and
interacting with a user’s screen in a human-like manner.
By utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Bézier curve-based mouse movements, Pixeler provides the tools
necessary for building bots that can perform tasks like identifying text on the screen, responding to UI changes, and
executing precise mouse interactions.


### Features

    OCR-Based Screen Reading: Accurately read and interpret text on the screen, enabling bots to understand what’s happening in real-time.
    Human-like Mouse Movements: Simulate realistic, human-like mouse movements using Bézier curves to interact with UI elements naturally.
    Window-Specific Targeting: Focus on specific windows based on their titles, allowing the bot to interact with the correct application.
    Flexible Automation: Design bots that can respond to changes in the UI dynamically, making them adaptable to various applications.

### Installation

You can install Pixeler via pip:

`pip install pixeler`

# Usage

`import Pixeler.bot`

### Extend the bot

Create your own class extending the Pixeler Bot class

```
class MyBot(Bot):
    ...
```

### Initialize the bot

```
bot = MyBot(title="Target Application")
```

### Examples
See the examples folder for Bot Usage examples. More coming soon!
